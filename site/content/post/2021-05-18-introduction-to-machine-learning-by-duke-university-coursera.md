I started the "Introduction to Machine Learning" from the Duke University in Coursera. It was available from the Coursera's 9 year anniversary offer. The offer allowed users to get one free course with free certification from the nine different specialties. And I decided on getting the "Machine Learning" course.

I started the course today and am deciding to finish the course content for the first week soon. The week starts off with the basics of machine learning and delves slightly in logistic regression with its algorithm and math.

As a last section for today. It also contains a Python Prerequisites for the course. Which can be used as a refresher with Python basics including NumPy and Matplotlib Plotting.

Hope to continue tomorrow with Multilayer Perception.
